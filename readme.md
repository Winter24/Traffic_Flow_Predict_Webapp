## Overview

The Traffic Flow Prediction Webapp uses machine learning models to forecast traffic patterns based on historical data. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with, where users can upload traffic data (e.g., traffic counts, vehicle speeds) and view predictions for future traffic conditions.

This application is powered by Python, Flask for the web framework, and integrates various data science libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Features

- Predict future traffic flow based on historical traffic data.
- User-friendly interface to input traffic data.
- Real-time traffic flow prediction display base of street camera's image.
- Visualization of predicted traffic patterns.

### Prerequisites
- Python (>= 3.7)
